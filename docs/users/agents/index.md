# Agents Overview

Managing agents and automatically syncing them with your user management tools can be automated via the API. This article covers the basics of creating, reading, updating and deleting Agents.

!!! note
    Agents must be associated with an Agent Group so you need to have at least one Agent Group configured before managing Agents. See [Agent Groups](../agent-groups) for more.
