-   Dialing groups determine the dialing mode - this is the "How" a call will be made with.

-   Campaigns are nested within the dialing groups, are the reasons for calling - this is the "Why" we are calling.

-   Leads are the contacts, the people or the customers we are dialing - this is the "Who" we are calling.

-   Dispositions allows agents to mark the outcomes of a call - this describes what happened on that call.

Dialing components are comprised of lots of configurations. To create them via UI interfaces usually a time consuming process. The Campaigns, Leads and other related APIs provide useful functionalities to fully or partially automate the creation process programmatically. Especially, when it comes to importing data from other data sources, e.g. importing leads information from your own CRM system.
