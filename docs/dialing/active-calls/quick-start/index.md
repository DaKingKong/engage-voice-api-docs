# Getting Started with Active Calls

Active Call APIs allow you to programmatically read agents' active call data. Active calls can be read based on a category called "Product".

The Quick Start guides below will guide you in using our Call Answering Rules API in less than five minutes. The Call Answering Rules API allows you to query all preset answering rules for a particular extension (user). You can then use the unique answering rule id returned by the API to get details of that answering rule, or to update the rule with new values.
