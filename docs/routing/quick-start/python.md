# Create a Dial group - Python Quick Start

Welcome to the Engage Voice Platform.

In this Quick Start, we are going to create a queue group for an account. Let's get started.

## Create an App

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create Engage Voice App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a target="_new" href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/new-app?name=Engage+Voice+Quick+Start+App&desc=A+simple+app+to+demo+engage+voice+apis+access&public=false&type=ServerOther&carriers=7710,7310,3420&permissions=ReadAccounts&redirectUri=" class="btn btn-primary">Create Engage Voice App</a>
<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Give your app a name and description, then click Next.</li>
<li>On the second page of the create app wizard enter the following:
  <ul>
  <li>Select 'Private' for Application Type.</li>
  <li>Select 'Server-only (No UI)' for Platform Type.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>On the third page of the create app wizard, select the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>ReadAccounts</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>We are using Password Flow authentication, so leave "OAuth Redirect URI" blank.</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Create a Queue Group for an Engage Voice Account

### Install Engage Voice SDK Wrapper for Python

```bash
pip3 install ringcentral_engage_voice
# or
pip install ringcentral_engage_voice
```

### Create and Edit create-queue-group.py

Create a file called <tt>create-queue-group.py</tt>. Be sure to edit the variables in ALL CAPS with your app and user credentials.

```python
from ringcentral_engage_voice import RingCentralEngageVoice

def create_a_queue_group():
    try:
        postBody = {
            "groupName": "My New Queue Group"
        }
        response = ev.post("/api/v1/admin/accounts/{accountId}/gateGroups", postBody).json()
        print(response)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)


# Instantiate the SDK wrapper object with your RingCentral app credentials
ev = RingCentralEngageVoice(
    "RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID",
    "RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET")

try:
    # Authorize with your RingCentral Office user credentials
    ev.authorize(
        username="RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME",
        password="RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD",
        extension="RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION"
    )

    create_a_queue_group()
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Run Your Code

You are almost done. Now run your script.

```bash
$ python create-queue-group.py
```
