# Unique Integration APIs

When integraing workforce management with our contact center platform, you may also want to connect to our RingCentral MVP platform. For example, agents may have a need to contact other employeess who are not agents and are part of the back office. Those employees will have a RingCentral MVP account and you'll need the RingCentral user ID to lookup the address book and find contacts that are only in the back office. In those cases, you need a mapping between the RingCentral user ID and Engage Voice agent ID.

## User List

The [public user list](https://developers.ringcentral.com/engage/voice/api-reference/Users/listAllUsers) most developers will use has many details including creation date, enabled status, and roles. However, for integrations, a smaller set of user data may be all that is needed, but with the added ability to distinguish the Engage user name from the RingCentral user name and the environment ID. For this purpose, there's an [integration user list](https://developers.ringcentral.com/engage/voice/api-reference/Integration-User-Controller/getUserList) that can be used instead.

## Sub-Accounts

Each main account has a sub-account where most customers reside. However, for partners, more sub-accounts may exist and retrieving [sub-accounts](https://developers.ringcentral.com/engage/voice/api-reference/Integration-Account-Controller/getSubAccountsByMainAccountId) may be useful for determining which account is being used by the customer.

## Agents

Most developers will want a list of agents and agent groups, but for workforce management, there are additional details that are important to know about agents.  [Agents](https://developers.ringcentral.com/engage/voice/api-reference/Agents/getAgentList) are derived from RingCentral MVP users and the RingCentral User ID will map to an agent ID in Engage Voice.  Along with this detail, you cand also retrieve the agent's supervisors as an array of agent IDs, or if the agent is a supervisor, a list of agents that the agent supervises (`superviseeAgentIds`).

## Queue Groups

Once known as gates, queues are inbound routing rules for customers calling in to a number. Typically, queues have agents assigned to them and each queue would have to be iterated through to find all the agents assigned to a queue group. However, the [gate group with agents](https://developers.ringcentral.com/engage/voice/api-reference/Integration-Gate-Group-Controller/getGateGroupsWithAgents) integration API allows you to get a complete list of all queues in a queue group and the agents contained in that queue in a single call.

## Integration Reports

The integration reports are special reports for integration purposes to assist with better workforce management. The integration reports consists of the following reports for agent and queue statistics.

* Agent Extended Statistics Report - An extended agent and queue report with call counts and durations
* Agent Segment Metadata Report - A detailed agent interaction report by segment for each call
* Queue Statistics Report - A specific report that lists all the queues in a queue group and the agents within each queue.

### Agent Extended Statistics Report

The report file can be in either CSV or XML format. The table below explains the fields of each interval.

| Field | Description |
|-|-|
| interval | period of time in minutes in 15, 30, 45, or 60 minute lengths. |
| date_from | start date for this interval |
| time (H24:MI) | time in hour:minute format of the current interval |
| agent_id | the agent's unique identifier |
| agent_name | the agent's full name |
| queue | the queue's unique identifier in which the agent is in |
| queue_name | the queue's name in which the agent is in |
| talking_call_dur | total handling time (in seconds) on the call |
| wrap_up_dur | Total wrap-up time or after call work (in seconds), associated with queue calls answered by the agent |
| answ_call_cnt | number of answered calls (only calls through a queue)|
| transfer_out_call_cnt | number of calls answered and then transferred to a queue |

### Agent Segment Metadata Report

Also known as the interaction metadata report, this report is broken down into call legs, or also known as segments. Each segment consists of an interaction between a single agent and client. Each client could have have multiple segments as they are transferred to different agents, but each agent has only a single segment with a client.

The report file can be in either CSV or XML format. The table below explains the fields of each segment.

| Field | Description |
|-|-|
| Interaction.Id | each call is uniquely identified by this ID (UII) |
| Interaction.RecordingLocation | the entire call recording in ?single channel (mono)? format |
| Interaction.StartTime | start time of the call in HH:MM:SS format |
| Interaction.Duration | lenght of time of the call in ?minutes? |
| Segment.ID | the identifier for the call leg that typically begins at `2` |
| Segment.AgentID | the agent identifier of the agent for this call leg |
| Segment.AgentGroupID | the agent group identifier of the agent group this agent belongs to, for this call leg |
| Segment.ContactStartTime | the start time for a call leg in ANSI SQL 92 `TIMESTAMP` format such as: `2020-04-22 00:00:00.0000`|
| Segment.ContactEndTime | the end time for a call leg in ANSI SQL 92 `TIMESTAMP` format such as: `2020-04-22 00:00:00.0000`|
| Segment.Duration | the amount of talk time for a call leg in HH:MM:SS format |
| Segment.CallingAddress | the phone number of the person making the call (this could be the agent or the customer) |
| Segment.CalledAddress | the phone number of the person who is receiving thecall (this could be the agent or the customer) |
| Segment.Direction | the direction of the call whether `INBOUND` or `OUTBOUND` |
| Segment.RecordingURL | the call recording for this call leg (note, there could be many legs to a single call if the call is transferred) |
